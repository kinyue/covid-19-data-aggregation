'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested. 
I hope it helps.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

'Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH? 

My immediate questions are:

1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them? 
2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them? 
3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?

Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others. 

Thanks so much!'

'Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February. 
The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed. 
The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.

Effective 11 April, all of Jalalabad City is to be on complete lockdown with civilians told to stay home, barring leaving to buy food, medicines, or other essential items as well as emergency cases.

In addition, provincial GOA authorities have limited the numbers of days and hours food shops and markets are permitted to be open, with such shops allowed to be open only four days a week during daytime hours.

Close contacts are defined as: (i) anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed case within about 1 metre distance for at least 30 minutes in an enclosed area or; (ii) anyone who has stayed at the same place (e.g. household, office space, social gathering) as a confirmed case.
